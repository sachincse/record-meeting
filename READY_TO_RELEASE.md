## 🎯 Release Options

### Option 1: Automated Release via GitHub Actions (Recommended)

Since you've already configured `PYPI_API_TOKEN` in GitHub, you can use automated releases:

1. **Push your code to GitHub**:
   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "chore: prepare for v0.2.0 release"
   git push origin main
   ```

2. **Create a GitHub Release**:
   - Go to: https://github.com/sachincse/recordmymeeting/releases
   - Click "Create a new release"
   - Click "Choose a tag" → Type `v0.2.0` → Click "Create new tag: v0.2.0 on publish"
   - Release title: `v0.2.0`
   - Description: Copy from CHANGELOG.md:
     ```
     ## [0.2.0] - 2025-10-19
     
     ### Added
     - PyPI package structure and metadata
     - Automated GitHub Actions release workflow
     - Comprehensive documentation (README, RELEASING, CONTRIBUTING)
     - Python API examples
     - Hardware-independent test suite
     
     ### Changed
     - Package renamed from `recordflow` to `recordmymeeting`
     - CLI command: `recordflow` → `recordmymeeting`
     - GUI command: `recordflow-gui` → `recordmymeeting-gui`
     - Updated all imports and module references
     - Improved setup.py with dynamic versioning
     
     ### Fixed
     - Test suite now works without audio hardware
     - Proper package metadata for PyPI
     ```
   - Click "Publish release"

3. **Monitor the workflow**:
   - Go to: https://github.com/sachincse/recordmymeeting/actions
   - Watch the "Publish to PyPI" workflow run
   - It will:
     - Run tests on Python 3.8, 3.9, 3.10, 3.11
     - Build the package
     - Publish to PyPI automatically

4. **Verify on PyPI**:
   - Check: https://pypi.org/project/recordmymeeting/
   - Test install: `pip install recordmymeeting`

### Option 2: Manual Release (Fallback)

If you prefer manual control or GitHub Actions fails:

```bash
# 1. Ensure you're in the project directory
cd c:\Users\sachi\codes\winsurf\record-meeting

# 2. Clean old builds (if any)
Remove-Item dist,build,"*.egg-info" -Recurse -Force -ErrorAction SilentlyContinue

# 3. Build the package
python -m build

# 4. Check the distribution
python -m twine check dist/*

# 5. Upload to TestPyPI first (recommended)
python -m twine upload --repository testpypi dist/*

# 6. Test installation from TestPyPI
pip install --index-url https://test.pypi.org/simple/ --extra-index-url https://pypi.org/simple recordmymeeting

# 7. If everything works, upload to PyPI
python -m twine upload dist/*
```
