# Legal Compliance

Recording laws vary by jurisdiction. Always obtain consent before recording audio or screen.

## Consent Requirements

- Mic-only recording is generally safe for interviews.
- Speaker/system audio and screen recording require explicit permission.
- Laws differ by country and state; check local regulations.

## Best Practices

- Inform all parties before recording.
- Use mic-only mode for compliance unless permission is granted.
- Store recordings securely and delete when no longer needed.

## Default Behavior

RecordMyMeeting defaults to mic-only mode to minimize legal exposure.
