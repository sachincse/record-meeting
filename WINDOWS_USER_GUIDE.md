## Common Issues and Solutions

### 1. ‚ùå Window Close Button Not Working
**Status**: ‚úÖ FIXED in v0.2.0

The window close button now properly handles all scenarios:

- **When no recording**: Closes normally
- **When scheduled**: Allows cancellation

### 2. ‚ùå Speaker Recording Fails - "Invalid number of channels"
**Problem**: Most Windows speaker devices don't support direct recording.

**Solution**: Enable "Stereo Mix" device

#### How to Enable Stereo Mix on Windows 11/10:

1. **Right-click** the speaker icon in the system tray
2. Click **"Sound settings"** or **"Open Sound settings"**
3. Scroll down and click **"More sound settings"** or **"Sound Control Panel"**
4. Go to the **"Recording"** tab
5. **Right-click** in the empty space and check:
   - ‚úÖ **"Show Disabled Devices"**
   - ‚úÖ **"Show Disconnected Devices"**
6. You should now see **"Stereo Mix"**
7. **Right-click** on "Stereo Mix" and select **"Enable"**
8. **Right-click** again and select **"Set as Default Device"** (optional)
9. Click **"OK"**

#### Alternative: Use Virtual Audio Cable
If Stereo Mix is not available:
- Install **VB-Audio Virtual Cable** (free): https://vb-audio.com/Cable/
- Or **VoiceMeeter** (free): https://vb-audio.com/Voicemeeter/

### 3. ‚ö†Ô∏è Microphone Test Shows "Too Quiet"

   - Solution: Use Stereo Mix (see #2 above)
   
2. **Microphone device not properly selected**
   - Solution: Click "Refresh Devices" and select correct microphone
   
3. **Permissions issue**
   - Solution: Check Windows Privacy Settings:

```
recordings/
  ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ recording_20251019_163000/
      ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ screen.mp4          # Screen recording
      ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ microphone.wav      # Your voice
      ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ speaker.wav         # System audio
      ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ merged.wav          # Combined mic + speaker
```

## Device Selection Tips

### Microphone Devices
Look for these in the device list:
- **Built-in Microphone** - Laptop mic
- **USB Microphone** - External USB mic
- **Headset Microphone** - Gaming/call headset
- **Array Microphone** - Multi-mic array
- **Bluetooth Microphone** - Wireless headset

### Speaker/System Audio Devices
For recording system audio, look for:
- **Stereo Mix** ‚≠ê (Best option for Windows)
- **WASAPI Loopback** devices
- **Virtual Audio Cable** devices
- **VoiceMeeter** devices

**Note**: Regular speaker output devices (like "Speakers" or "Headphones") will show "Invalid number of channels" error because they don't support input recording.

## CLI Usage

### List Available Devices
```bash
recordmymeeting --list-devices
```

### Record Microphone Only (Compliance-Friendly)
```bash
recordmymeeting --source mic --duration 30
```

### Record Everything
```bash
recordmymeeting --source all --duration 30
```

### Record with Specific Devices
```bash
# First, list devices to get indices
recordmymeeting --list-devices

# Then record with specific device indices
recordmymeeting --source all --mic-device 1 --speaker-device 44 --duration 30
```

### Schedule Recording
```bash
recordmymeeting --source mic --schedule 14:30 --duration 60
```

## Troubleshooting

### Error: "Failed to open speaker stream: Invalid audio channels"

### GUI Doesn't Launch
**Solution**:
```bash
# Make sure you're in the virtual environment
venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1

# Reinstall the package
pip install -e .

# Try launching again
recordmymeeting-gui
```

### Recording Stops Immediately
**Possible causes**:
1. No recording source selected (check at least one: Mic/Speaker/Screen)
2. Device initialization failed (check logs)
3. Permissions issue

**Solution**:
- Check the status message in the GUI
- Look at console output for error messages
- Use device test buttons to verify each component works

## Performance Tips

### For Long Recordings
- **Lower FPS**: Use 5-10 FPS instead of 30 for screen recording
- **Close unnecessary apps**: Free up system resources
- **Use SSD**: Save recordings to SSD for better performance
- **Monitor disk space**: Ensure sufficient space (1 hour ‚âà 1-2 GB)

### For Better Quality
- **Higher FPS**: Use 20-30 FPS for smooth screen recording
- **48000 Hz audio**: Use 48000 Hz instead of 44100 Hz
- **Stereo**: Use 2 channels instead of 1 for richer audio
- **External mic**: Use USB microphone for better voice quality

## Legal Compliance

### Recording Your Own Voice (Microphone Only)
- ‚úÖ Generally legal in most jurisdictions
- ‚úÖ No consent needed (you're recording yourself)
- ‚úÖ Recommended for interviews, meetings, lectures

### Recording System Audio / Others' Voices
- ‚ö†Ô∏è May require consent depending on jurisdiction
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Check local laws (one-party vs two-party consent)
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Inform participants before recording
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Some platforms (Zoom, Teams) have built-in recording with notifications

**Best Practice**: Always inform participants and get consent before recording.
