# RecordMyMeeting v0.2.0 - Complete Solution Summary

## 🎉 All Issues Fixed!

### ✅ Issue #1: Window Close Button Not Working
**Problem**: GUI window wouldn't close when clicking the X button.

**Root Cause**: The `_on_window_close()` method had an `else` clause that only handled the "Cancel" case but didn't handle the "no recording active" case.

**Fix Applied**:
```python
# Before (broken):
if self._active_recording or self._scheduled:
    # Handle recording in progress
    ...
else:
    self._is_closing = False
    return  # This prevented closing when no recording!

# After (fixed):
if self._active_recording or self._scheduled:
    # Handle recording in progress with 3 options
    if response is not None:  # Yes or No
        self._cleanup_on_exit()
        self.root.destroy()
    else:  # Cancel
        self._is_closing = False
        return
else:
    # No recording active - close normally
    self._cleanup_on_exit()
    self.root.destroy()
```

**File**: `recordmymeeting/gui_app.py`, lines 846-917

### ✅ Issue #2: Speaker File Not Created
**Problem**: When recording mic + speaker + screen, only `screen.mp4` was created. No `microphone.wav` or `speaker.wav` files.

**Root Cause**: Bug #1 in `core.py` - The condition check was combined:
```python
# Before (broken):
if self.record_speaker and self.speaker_file and self.speaker_frames:
    # Save speaker audio
```
If `self.speaker_frames` was empty, the file wasn't created at all.

**Fix Applied** (Bug #1):
```python
# After (fixed):
if self.record_speaker and self.speaker_file:
    if self.speaker_frames:
        # Save speaker audio
    else:
        logger.warning("Speaker was set to record, but no audio frames were captured.")
```

**File**: `recordmymeeting/core.py`, `_save_audio()` method, lines 463-481

---

### ✅ Issue #3: Speaker Recording - "Invalid number of channels"
**Problem**: Error message: `[Errno -9998] Invalid number of channels` when trying to record speaker audio.

**Root Cause**: Most Windows speaker output devices have `maxInputChannels = 0`, meaning they don't support input recording. The code wasn't validating this before trying to open the stream.

**Fix Applied**:
```python
# Added validation:
max_channels = int(device_info.get('maxInputChannels', 0))

if max_channels == 0:
    raise Exception(f"Invalid audio channels: Device {self.speaker_index} does not support input recording (maxInputChannels=0). On Windows, try 'Stereo Mix' device.")
```

**File**: `recordmymeeting/core.py`, lines 316-321

**User Solution**: Enable "Stereo Mix" device in Windows Sound settings (see WINDOWS_USER_GUIDE.md)

---

### ✅ Issue #4: Microphone Test Shows "Too Quiet"
**Problem**: Microphone test always showed "too quiet" even when speaking normally.

**Root Cause**: Volume threshold was set too high at 100.

**Fix Applied**:
```python
# Before:
if max_vol > 100:  # Too high!

# After:
if max_vol > 50:  # More sensitive
```

**Files**: 
- `recordmymeeting/gui_app.py`, line 386 (microphone test)
- `recordmymeeting/gui_app.py`, line 457 (speaker test)

---

## 🔧 Additional Fixes

### ✅ Bug #2: Merged Audio File Creation Error
**Problem**: `AttributeError: 'AudioFile' object has no attribute 'nframes'` when creating merged audio.

**Root Cause**: Code was using `audioread` library which returns an `AudioFile` object without direct `nframes` attribute.

**Fix Applied**:
```python
# Before (broken):
with audioread.audio_open(self.mic_file) as f:
    mic_nframes = f.nframes  # AttributeError!

# After (fixed):
with wave.open(self.mic_file, 'rb') as wf_mic:
    mic_nframes = wf_mic.getnframes()  # Direct access
```

**File**: `recordmymeeting/core.py`, `_merge_audio()` method, lines 487-527

---

### ✅ Duplicate Cleanup Code Removed
**Problem**: GUI had duplicate cleanup code causing confusion.

**Fix**: Removed duplicate `_cleanup_on_exit()` implementation.

**File**: `recordmymeeting/gui_app.py`, lines 920-941

---

### ✅ Dynamic Device Switching
**Feature**: Automatically detects when audio devices change (e.g., plugging in headphones) and switches to the new device.

**Implementation**: Checks every 2 seconds for device changes during recording.

**File**: `recordmymeeting/core.py`, lines 340-408
